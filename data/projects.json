      "description": ["Ayasdi Core is what I spend most of time working on as a frontend engineer for Ayasdi.", "Core is the first of several applications Ayasdi is building to help industries explore large, complex data sets with digestible visualizations. It is built with minimal dependencies (Backbone, D3, Zepto), and with a design framework we have created that extends across all of our applications."]

      "description": ["Strummify is a web application for learning guitar. I taught myself how to code using sites like Udacity & Codeacademy, and figured that the same approach could be taken for musical instruments. The goal was to provide real time, interactive feedback on your guitar playing. Employing the help of some friends, we created a prototype that included polyphonic pitch detection and a simple user interface.", "Unfortunately, Strummify has not had much love and support since I finished my Masters program at Stanford. The pitch detection needs significant improvement and the backend, created somewhat hastily towards the end of the quarter, is in need of repairs."]

This was my first introduction to responsive design, and as I was purely on the design side of this project (and not on engineering), I now sympathize greatly with the <a href='http://www.marcosiglesias.com/home'>sole frontend engineer</a> on the project."]

Our goal was to create an application where people started conversations regarding specific places of interest.", "At its peak, Disgo had upwards of 20 users. Unfortunately, Stanford discontinued my personal student directory once I graduated, and Disgo is now disgone."]
